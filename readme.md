Commands

All commands must be preferenced with either ! or \

commands include:
!r - roll dice,  examples of syntax: !r 2d20+d4 + 5
!r only allows for one modifier, and the numeric modifier and its operator must have a space between themselves and the dice being rolled.
Likewise !r when being used to roll multiple types of dice (d20, d4 etc.) must have no spaces between and just an operator (+ or -).

!ra will roll the first type of dice (4d6+d4) the 4d6 in this example, with advantage then function like a normal roll and follows the same syntax.
!rd is the same except it rolls with disadvantage.
!re rolls 2d20 and takes the one which has the largest difference from 10. its syntax is just !re

!sn saves your name! So if you want to have a special name appear for when you roll dice.
This is server locked, so you can have a different name server to server and it can be reset at any time.

!sk this will switcvh the karma mode.
!disDat this command displays relavent data.
